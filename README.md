# Text Compression with PyTorch

This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive guide to implementing a text compression model using PyTorch. It covers data processing, evaluation tools creation, compression and decompression algorithm implementation, and the development and utilization of a neural language model for text compression. The notebook is structured as follows:

* Data Processing: Loading and processing datasets for training, development, and testing. Vocabulary extraction and tokenization are also discussed.
* Evaluation Tools: Creation of a mock model to evaluate the language model's performance in terms of compression and decompression.
* Compression and Decompression: Detailed explanation and implementation of the algorithms for compressing and decompressing text using a language model.
* Neural Language Model: Training a neural language model on the processed data, evaluating its performance, and analyzing the compression effectiveness.
The notebook includes code snippets for each part, alongside explanations for the methodologies used. It leverages PyTorch for model development and evaluation, showcasing techniques such as early stopping, perplexity calculation, and more.

The compression and decompression processes described in the notebook are intricate and based on the predictions of a language model. Here's a summary of how they work:

### Compression
1. Initial Steps: The text to be compressed is tokenized, creating a list of tokens and corresponding indexes.
2. Using the Language Model: The language model is applied to these indexes to predict the next most probable token for each position.
3. Determining Predictability: If a token predicted by the model matches the actual token in the text, it indicates that the model can accurately predict this token based on the preceding context. Such tokens are replaced with a special marker, "X", which signifies that the token can be predicted and doesn't need to be explicitly stored.
4. Resulting Compression: Tokens that the model can predict are thus replaced by "X", making the text shorter. This process leverages the predictability of certain tokens based on context, effectively compressing the text by removing predictable information.
### Decompression
1. Initial Steps: The compressed text, which includes "X" markers for predictable tokens, is tokenized into a list of tokens.
2. Reconstruction: The decompression process iterates through the tokens, using the language model to predict and replace "X" markers with the most probable token that fits the given context.
3. Sequential Processing: This prediction and replacement process continues for every "X" marker in the sequence. Since the model predicts based on preceding context, which is gradually reconstructed, each step depends on the accuracy of the previous predictions.
4. Restoring Original Text: The process ultimately reconstructs the original text by replacing all "X" markers with their predicted tokens, effectively decompressing the text back to its original form.


This approach to text compression and decompression is highly dependent on the effectiveness of the language model. A more accurate model can predict more tokens correctly, leading to higher compression rates without loss of information, as it allows for more tokens to be replaced by "X" during compression and accurately restored during decompression.
